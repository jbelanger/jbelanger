I am a full-stack software developer specialising in the .NET ecosystem. My career started 15 years ago in the Employment and Social Development Canada public service department.

I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and my focus is currently on everything about DevOps. My favorites authors are Martin Fowler, Eric Evans and Vladimir Khorikov. The latter introduced me to Functionnal Principles in C#, which changed my way of coding.

I enjoy working on software and constantly update it based on latest innovations in the industry and/or the community. I love doing R&D and I feel I am missing something if I don't include that latest trend in my projects.

I am on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-belanger-698a86245/">LinkedIn</a>, you can reach me there if you want more info about myself or my work.

Oh and by the way, you can find my up-to-date work experiences by cloning this repository and by using the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph">GitGraph</a> extension in Visual Studio Code or the git log command.
